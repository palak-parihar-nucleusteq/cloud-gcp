This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on emulating the behavior of Google Cloud Services, specifically *BigQuery*, *Firestore*, and *Pub/Sub*, locally for testing and development purposes. By mimicking the functionality of these services in a local environment, developers can streamline the development process, reduce costs associated with cloud usage during testing, and enhance overall development efficiency.
